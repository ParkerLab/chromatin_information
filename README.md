## Description
This repository will allow you to generate all the main figures from our manuscript.

## Usage
### Browsing processed results
The `notebooks_processed` folder contains a Rmd (R Markdown) file for each set of analyses. Just open these files in RStudio and knit the html output.
### Generating results from scratch
1. Go to each of the `analyses` subfolders **in order** and run the commands described in the README.
2. Go to the `notebooks_local` folder and execute the Rmd files. They should be able to knit the html output once step 1 is complete.

## Software requirements
### Using our conda environment
Assuming that you have a Linux 64-bit system, download and install Anaconda 3:
```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Create the base environment:
```sh
conda env create --file env/base.yml
source activate chromatin_information
```
This will provide most of the command line software (python, R, samtools, *etc*.)

### Install other software
Fetch the necessary R packages
```sh
Rscript scripts/install_dependencies.R
```
